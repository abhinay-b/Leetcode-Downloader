An easy method to download all the leetcode submissions.

Dependencies needed to be downloaded:

1. Selenium (pip install selenium)
2. Google Chrome browser
3. Chrome Driver: Download the version that matches your chrome browser from <a href="https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads"> here</a>. Extract it into the same directory as the code.

Procedure:

1. Install the depencies and run the python file or the cells in jupyter notebook
2. You'll be prompted to enter your leetcode/google credentials to login. Enter and watch chrome being controlled by the automated test software.
3. Note: Incase there's a captcha while logging in, please complete the captcha and press 'y' in the shell/notebook to continue.
